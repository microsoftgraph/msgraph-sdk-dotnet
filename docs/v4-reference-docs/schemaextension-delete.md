# Delete schemaExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete the definition of a [schema extension](../resources/schemaextension.md). Only the app that created the schema extension (owner app) can delete the schema extension definition, and only when the extension is in the `InDevelopment` state. Deleting a schema extension definition does not affect accessing custom data that has been added to resource instances based on that definition.


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally for the delegated flow, the signed-in user can only delete schemaExtensions they own (where the **owner** property of the schemaExtension is the `appId` of an application the signed-in user owns).
